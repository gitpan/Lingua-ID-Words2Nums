NAME
    Lingua::ID::Words2Nums - Convert Indonesian verbage to number

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.16 of Lingua::ID::Words2Nums (from
    Perl distribution Lingua-ID-Words2Nums), released on 2014-09-28.

SYNOPSIS
     use Lingua::ID::Words2Nums qw(words2nums words2nums_simple);

     print words2nums("seratus tiga koma dua");  # 103.2
     print words2nums("minus 3 juta 100 ribu");  # 3100000

     print words2nums("-1.3e4");                 # 13000

     print words2nums_simple("satu dua tiga");   # 123

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides two functions, words2nums and words2nums_simple.
    They are the counterpart of Lingua::ID::Nums2Words's nums2words and
    nums2words_simple.

FUNCTIONS
  words2nums(@args) -> any
    Convert Indonesian verbage to number.

    Parse Indonesian verbage and return number, or undef if failed (unknown
    verbage or 'syntax error'). In English, this is equivalent to converting
    "one hundred and twenty three" to 123. Currently can handle real numbers
    in normal and scientific form in the order of hundreds of trillions.

    Will produce unexpected result if you feed it stupid verbage.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   str* => *str*

        The verbage to convert.

    Return value:

     (any)

  words2nums_simple(@args) -> any
    Like words2nums, but can only parse sequence of digits.

    In English, this is equivalent to converting "one two three" to 123.

    Will produce unexpected result if you feed it stupid verbage.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   str* => *str*

        The verbage to convert.

    Return value:

     (any)

EXPORTS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (regex)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting verbage from text; it looks for
    a string of words. It's not perfect (improper verbage might be allowed,
    e.g. "dua ribu tiga juta"), but it's convenient.

    Currently only multipliers up to trillions ("triliun") are recognized.
    Bigger multipliers are usually only found in scientific text.

SEE ALSO
