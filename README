NAME
    Lingua::ID::Words2Nums - Convert Indonesian verbage to number

VERSION
    version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
     use Lingua::ID::Words2Nums qw(words2nums words2nums_simple);

     print words2nums("seratus dua puluh tiga"); # 123
     print words2nums_simple("satu dua tiga");   # 123

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides two functions, words2nums and words2nums_simple.
    They are the counterpart of Lingua::ID::Nums2Words's nums2words and
    <nums2words_simple>.

  FUNCTIONS
    None are exported, but they are exportable.

  words2nums(STR) => NUM|undef
    Parse Indonesian verbage and return number, or undef if failed (unknown
    verbage or 'syntax error'). In English, this is equivalent to converting
    "one hundred and twenty three" to 123. Currently can handle real numbers
    in normal and scientific form in the order of hundreds of trillions.

    Will produce unexpected result if you feed it stupid verbage.

  words2nums_simple(STR) => NUM|undef
    Like words2nums, but can only handle spelled digits (like "one two
    three" => 123 in English).
