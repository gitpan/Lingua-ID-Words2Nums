DESCRIPTION
    This module provides two functions, words2nums and words2nums_simple.
    They are the counterpart of Lingua::ID::Nums2Words's nums2words and
    nums2words_simple.

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting verbage from text; it looks for
    a string of words. It's not perfect (the extracted verbage might not be
    valid, e.g. "ribu tiga"), but it's simple and fast.

SEE ALSO
    Lingua::ID::Nums2Words

    Parse::Number::ID is used to parse numbers in the verbage.
