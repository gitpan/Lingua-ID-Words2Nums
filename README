VERSION
    version 0.14

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides two functions, words2nums and words2nums_simple.
    They are the counterpart of Lingua::ID::Nums2Words's nums2words and
    nums2words_simple.

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting verbage from text; it looks for
    a string of words. It's not perfect (the extracted verbage might not be
    valid, e.g. "ribu tiga"), but it's simple and fast.

  FUNCTIONS
    None are exported, but they are exportable.

  words2nums(STR) => NUM|undef
    Parse Indonesian verbage and return number, or undef if failed (unknown
    verbage or 'syntax error'). In English, this is equivalent to converting
    "one hundred and twenty three" to 123. Currently can handle real numbers
    in normal and scientific form in the order of hundreds of trillions.

    Will produce unexpected result if you feed it stupid verbage.

  words2nums_simple(STR) => NUM|undef
    Like words2nums, but can only handle spelled digits (like "one two
    three" => 123 in English).

SEE ALSO
    Lingua::ID::Nums2Words

    Parse::Number::ID is used to parse numbers in the verbage.
